// Hashable s a protocol that means Swift can generate hash values for it, which in turn means we can use \.self for the identifier. Similar to codable, if all of an object's properties conform to Hashable, the object itself conforms automatically. For Core Data specifically, the objects it creates for us actually have a selection of other properties beyond those we defined in our data model, including one called the object ID â€“ an identifier that is unique to that object, regardless of what properties it contains, so we can have two of the same object and they'll still be uniquely identifiable with \.self
